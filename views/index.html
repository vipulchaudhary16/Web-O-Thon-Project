                Agriculture plays a critical role in the entire life of a given economy. Agriculture is the backbone of
                the economic system of a given country. In addition to providing food and raw material, agriculture also
                provides employment opportunities to a very large percentage of the population. 
                By radically changing the way we acquire our food, the development of agriculture has condemned us to live worse than ever before. Not only that, agriculture has led to the first significant instances of large-scale war, inequality, poverty, crime, famine and human induced climate change and mass extinction. Agriculture is important to human beings because it forms the basis for food security. It helps human beings grow the most ideal food crops and raise the right animals with accordance to environmental factors. ... Agriculture also helps humans know the right way to use land so as to avoid disasters like famines.</p>
